               Release Notes for iSCSI Enterprise Target
               =========================================

                            April 13th, 2010
                             Version 1.4.20
                             --------------

The IET development team is pleased to announce the release of version
1.4.20 of the iSCSI Enterprise Target.

This release includes numerous bug fixes and compatibility improvements
and it is highly recommended that all production servers be on this
version for compatibility and stability reasons.

We would like to thank all those that contributed for this release. As
we are a small project we rely heavily on user contributions and we
welcome all who wish to participate in improving IET.

New since 1.4.19:

New Features:
- Added ability to atomically delete all targets/sessions/connections
- Added ability to move existing kernel module on install and move
  back on uninstall per distribution requirements (dpkg-divert)
- Added support for logical sector sizes (512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
  and devices whose native sector size > 512
- Added case insensitive volume parameter processing
- Added ability to set temporary target redirections via ietadm
  for existing targets
- Added support for auto-generating MD5 hash for SCSI ID, if not
  specified, and auto-setting SCSI SN to the hex of the SCSI ID,
  if not specified.

Experimental Features:
- Added experimental support for multiple connections per session

Updated Features:
- Updated kernel compatibility to 2.6.33
- Updated RPM and DKMS build/install/maintenance handling
- Updated kernel and usr ioctl functions to perform version checking
  between kernel module and ietd

Fixes:
- Fixed bug in ietd text final text response
- Fixed bug with reservation release during session deletion
- Fixed compliance issues around ABORT TASK/ABORT TASK SET
- Fixed fileio so it should work with all file system types
- Fixed session and connection reinstatement to work per RFC
- Fixed performance issue with CFQ scheduler
- Fixed corner case with fileio_sync missing last page in a sync
- Fixed bug in ietd where an interface without an address would
  cause it to go into an infinite loop.
- Fixed race condition between issuing ioctls during kernel cleanup
- Fixed race condition between ietd shutdown and initiators which
  would cause initiators to fail to reconnect properly
- Fixed a race condition with data-out handling with multiple
  connections per session
- Fixed possible wthread lost wakeup condition when the number of
  wthreads is less then the number of CPUs/cores.

New since 1.4.18:

- Added ability to limit number of sessions per target (MaxSessions)
- Added NOP-In heartbeat for connections so dropped or abandoned
  connections and their sessions close faster
- Fixed a serious bug in initiators.allow code
- Updated RPM .spec file with added SuSE compatibility and better
  overall cross-platform friendliness.

                             Version 1.4.18
                             --------------

The version numbering of IET has changed in this release from the 0.X.X
series to the 1.X.X series. We did this because we felt that, since IET
has been stable and in production use for many years now, it deserved a
version number that better reflected that stability and maturity. We
are preserving the minor/maintenance numbers though in order to help
maintain some consistency between prior and future releases.

New since 0.4.17:

- Added support for recent kernel versions up to 2.6.31
- Added support for even more targets via:
	* multi PDU support during discovery
	* improved procfs support
	* global thread pool (module parameter)
- Added support to list all target addresses during discovery, with
  the ability to filter those addresses via targets.allow
- Replaced initiators.deny with an implicit deny on a failure to find
  a match in initiators.allow while preserving backwards compatiblity
  with existing installations (iff initiators.deny doesn't exist)
- Added ability to filter initiators by their IQNs as well as their
  IP addresses, using basic regex pattern to specify IQNs
- Moved the config files to /etc/iet/ while preserving backwards
  compatiblity with existing installations (iff a valid config file
  exists in the new location will it be used)
- Added support for Unit Attention Conditions
	* SCSI RESERVE/RELEASE now issues a UAC on reservation loss
- Added support for DKMS and building RPM packages right from the
  source archive (from either the source tar ball or subversion)

Plus many many bug and compatibility fixes (see ChangeLog for details)
